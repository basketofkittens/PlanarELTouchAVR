First cut software library for driving Planar EL160.80.38-SM1 EL display with integrated touch screen and SED1330 display controller.

This lib is based on Frank Wallenwein's <fwallenwein@tklinux.de> SED1330 lib and Philip Pemberton's <philpem.me.uk> PIC code and reverse engineering.

Phil Pemberton's website has been a key resource for putting this lib together. Many thanks to him for his efforts. http://www.philpem.me.uk/elec/lcd/planar160x80/
